You don't want the soldiers to catch sight of you - most of them shoot first and don't bother asking questions later. Yet, as always, there are some who can be bribed as long as the top brass is looking the other way. Attacking the soldiers is not recommended, unless they pose a direct threat.

\nThe city's central feature is the town square, with a statue of Lenin in the middle. This square also houses the city's culture/sports centre and party headquarters. A short distance to the south-east lies the school, complete with a basketball court. The rest of the city is occupied by block housing, dilapidated single homes and garages.
\nOver the years, the city was stripped of most of its valuables and by 2012, it was practically an empty shell of its former self.
\nThe mercs had set a base for themselves in the sports centre, with Dushman being the leader.

			%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]The legendary lake in the sector of the same name dried up a long ago, leaving a shallow swamp in its place. The place is morbid and sodden with death. Great dangers await any adventurous soul foolish enough to get near it. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombie drones are rambling around the whole sector, waiting for new victims. If you walk around the lake and past the zombies, you'll end up at the scientists' camp, where the eggheads brought there by choppers are doing some research. You can have a chat with them; they buy artifacts and could even send you on a mission.

			%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]Zaton is the starting area of the game. The main body of the area - now a swamp - used to be part a large bay which is evident from many of the surrounding sights; huge ships, boats, and a docking area all tell a tale of the past. The grounded ships have been turned into makeshift homes for lone stalkers, and the center piece, the Skadovsk, now functions as a hub for stalkers, housing traders and providing a place for people to meet up, hang out, and get some rest. The surrounding area is ripe with interesting and dangerous places, including large concentrations of anomalies, a defunct weapon prototype testing facility, a water processing plant, and an old sawmill.
